#Contributor License Agreement

A contributor needs to accept [MixERP Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/mixerp/mixerp/blob/master/CLA.md) before we accept your pull request.

#How to Sign CLA?

Create a new pull request, adding a new file to the project. The file should be added to "/contributors" directory. The file name should be same as your GitHub username ending with ".md" extension. For example, for the GitHub user `alex`, the file would be `alex.md`. The file must have the following contents:

```
[date]

I hereby agree to the terms of the MixERP Contributors License
Agreement, as per the terms defined in the file "cla.md" in the root directory 
of https://github.com/mixerp/mixerp/ project.

I furthermore declare that I am authorized and able to make this
agreement and sign this declaration.

Signed,

[your name]
https://github.com/[your github username]
```

Replace the text in square brackets as follows:

* Replace `[date]` with the AD date since when you want your agreement to be effective from. The format should be `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY/MM/DD`.
* Replace `[your name]` with your legal name.
* Replace `[your github username]` with your GitHub username.
* Please make sure that link to your GitHub account is correct.

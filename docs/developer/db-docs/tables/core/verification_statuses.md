# core.verification_statuses table

Verification statuses are integer values used to represent the state of a transaction.
For example, a verification status of value "0" would mean that the transaction has not yet been verified.
A negative value indicates that the transaction was rejected, whereas a positive value means approved.

Remember:
1. Only approved transactions appear on ledgers and final reports.
2. Cash repository balance is maintained on the basis of LIFO principle. 

   This means that cash balance is affected (reduced) on your repository as soon as a credit transaction is posted,
   without the transaction being approved on the first place. If you reject the transaction, the cash balance then increases.
   This also means that the cash balance is not affected (increased) on your repository as soon as a debit transaction is posted.
   You will need to approve the transaction.

   It should however be noted that the cash repository balance might be less than the total cash shown on your balance sheet,
   if you have pending transactions to verify. You cannot perform EOD operation if you have pending verifications.

Click Ok.

## Directory Permission

Provide the following users write access to the directory `~/src/Frapid.Web`:

* IIS AppPool\frapid (or IIS AppPool\yoursitename).
* Authenticated Users (or Usuarios autenticados or utilisateurs authentifi√©s)

## Build Frapid

Open the frapid solutions in the mentioned order and perform a build:

* ~/src/Frapid.Web.sln
* ~/src/Frapid.Web/Areas/Frapid.Dashboard/Frapid.Dashboard.sln
* ~/src/Frapid.Web/Areas/Frapid.Config/Frapid.Config.sln
* ~/src/Frapid.Web/Areas/Frapid.Core/Frapid.Core.sln
* ~/src/Frapid.Web/Areas/Frapid.WebsiteBuilder/Frapid.WebsiteBuilder.sln
* ~/src/Frapid.Web/Areas/Frapid.Account/Frapid.Account.sln

Alternatively, you can also build frapid by running this batch file:

* ~/builds/all.bat

## Edit DbServer.config

Edit the configuration files:

* [PostgreSQL.config](../configs/PostgreSQL.config.md) or [SQLServer.config](../configs/SQLServer.config.md) (ideally both) for database access.
* [DomainsApproved.json](../configs/DomainsApproved.json.md) and change the "AdminEmail" for localhost domain to your own email address.

## Browse Frapid

Browse frapid on this URL : [https://localhost/install](https://localhost/install) and confirm SSL certificate exception. Wait a few minutes for the installation to complete. Reload the page.
You will notice that a database name "localhost" has been automatically created and populated for you.

## Configure Email Provider

Since you still do not have access to the admin area, you need to create an account for yourself. To verify your account, frapid will send account verification email.
You need to configure a transactional email provider.

- Create an account with [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com/) and edit the configuration file `~/Tenants/localhost/Configs/SMTP/SendGrid.json`.
- Or create an account with [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/) and edit the configuration file `~/Tenants/localhost/Configs/SMTP/SparkPost.json`.
* Enter from email.
* Enter API User.
* Enter API Key.
* Set Enabled to true.

## Sign Up

Navigate to the [sign up page](https://localhost/account/sign-up) and create an account for yourself. Verify your account and login to the admin area.

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

If you encounter installation issues, examine log files on [C:\frapid-logs](../configs/Parameters.config.md). If you want start over once again:

* delete the database "localhost".
* delete the directory ~/Tenants/localhost.
* delete the file [DomainsInstalled.json](../configs/DomainsInstalled.json.md).
